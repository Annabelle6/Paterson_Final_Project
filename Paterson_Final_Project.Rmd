```{r setup, include=FALSE}

I am working on two ideas. 

For one of my ideas, I am thinking of working with the tallest buildings in Nz and have this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Auckland but dont know how to extract the data as a file to work with. 

I am also thinking of working with the vineyards and wineries in Nz and I am still looking for more data on this. I found this website that talks about the data and I think I could create much better graphics for them. Their maps are disappointing and could be cool. But I cant seem to find data on this website. I might need to find it somewhere else http://nzwinedirectory.co.nz/wine-regions/
